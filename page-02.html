			<p class="intro">So yes, the instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace. And yet this truth must coexist with another &mdash; that no matter how justified, war promises human tragedy. The soldier&rsquo;s courage and sacrifice is full of glory, expressing devotion to country, to cause, to comrades in arms. But war itself is never glorious, and we must never trumpet it as such.</p>

			<p>So part of our challenge is reconciling these two seemingly irreconcilable truths &mdash; that war is sometimes necessary, and war at some level is an expression of human folly. Concretely, we must direct our effort to the task that President Kennedy called for long ago. &ldquo;Let us focus,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on a more practical, more attainable peace, based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions.&rdquo; A gradual evolution of human institutions.</p>

			<p>What might this evolution look like? What might these practical steps be?</p>

			<p>To begin with, I believe that all nations &mdash; strong and weak alike &mdash; must adhere to standards that govern the use of force. I &mdash; like any head of state &mdash; reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend my nation. Nevertheless, I am convinced that adhering to standards, international standards, strengthens those who do, and isolates and weakens those who don&rsquo;t.</p>

			<p class="pullquote" aria-hidden="true">More and more, we all confront difficult questions about how to prevent the slaughter of civilians by their own government, or to stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire region.</p>

			<p>The world rallied around America after the 9/11 attacks, and continues to support our efforts in Afghanistan, because of the horror of those senseless attacks and the recognized principle of self-defense. Likewise, the world recognized the need to confront Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait &mdash; a consensus that sent a clear message to all about the cost of aggression.</p>

			<p>Furthermore, America &mdash; in fact, no nation &mdash; can insist that others follow the rules of the road if we refuse to follow them ourselves. For when we don&rsquo;t, our actions appear arbitrary and undercut the legitimacy of future interventions, no matter how justified.</p>

			<p>And this becomes particularly important when the purpose of military action extends beyond self-defense or the defense of one nation against an aggressor. More and more, we all confront difficult questions about how to prevent the slaughter of civilians by their own government, or to stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire region.</p>

			<p>I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds, as it was in the Balkans, or in other places that have been scarred by war. Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later. That&rsquo;s why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace.</p>

			<p>America&rsquo;s commitment to global security will never waver. But in a world in which threats are more diffuse, and missions more complex, America cannot act alone. America alone cannot secure the peace. This is true in Afghanistan. This is true in failed states like Somalia, where terrorism and piracy is joined by famine and human suffering. And sadly, it will continue to be true in unstable regions for years to come.</p>

			<p>The leaders and soldiers of NATO countries, and other friends and allies, demonstrate this truth through the capacity and courage they&rsquo;ve shown in Afghanistan. But in many countries, there is a disconnect between the efforts of those who serve and the ambivalence of the broader public. I understand why war is not popular, but I also know this: The belief that peace is desirable is rarely enough to achieve it. Peace requires responsibility. Peace entails sacrifice. That&rsquo;s why NATO continues to be indispensable. That&rsquo;s why we must strengthen U.N. and regional peacekeeping, and not leave the task to a few countries. That&rsquo;s why we honor those who return home from peacekeeping and training abroad to Oslo and Rome; to Ottawa and Sydney; to Dhaka and Kigali &mdash; we honor them not as makers of war, but of wagers &mdash; but as wagers of peace.</p>

			<p>Let me make one final point about the use of force. Even as we make difficult decisions about going to war, we must also think clearly about how we fight it. The Nobel Committee recognized this truth in awarding its first prize for peace to Henry Dunant &mdash; the founder of the Red Cross, and a driving force behind the Geneva Conventions.</p>

			<p class="pullquote" aria-hidden="true">Those who claim to respect international law cannot avert their eyes when those laws are flouted.</p>

			<p>Where force is necessary, we have a moral and strategic interest in binding ourselves to certain rules of conduct. And even as we confront a vicious adversary that abides by no rules, I believe the United States of America must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war. That is what makes us different from those whom we fight. That is a source of our strength. That is why I prohibited torture. That is why I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed. And that is why I have reaffirmed America&rsquo;s commitment to abide by the Geneva Conventions. We lose ourselves when we compromise the very ideals that we fight to defend. (Applause.) And we honor &mdash; we honor those ideals by upholding them not when it&rsquo;s easy, but when it is hard.</p>

			<p>I have spoken at some length to the question that must weigh on our minds and our hearts as we choose to wage war. But let me now turn to our effort to avoid such tragic choices, and speak of three ways that we can build a just and lasting peace.</p>

			<p>First, in dealing with those nations that break rules and laws, I believe that we must develop alternatives to violence that are tough enough to actually change behavior &mdash; for if we want a lasting peace, then the words of the international community must mean something. Those regimes that break the rules must be held accountable. Sanctions must exact a real price. Intransigence must be met with increased pressure &mdash; and such pressure exists only when the world stands together as one.</p>

			<p>One urgent example is the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and to seek a world without them. In the middle of the last century, nations agreed to be bound by a treaty whose bargain is clear: All will have access to peaceful nuclear power; those without nuclear weapons will forsake them; and those with nuclear weapons will work towards disarmament. I am committed to upholding this treaty. It is a centerpiece of my foreign policy. And I&rsquo;m working with President Medvedev to reduce America and Russia&rsquo;s nuclear stockpiles.</p>

			<p>But it is also incumbent upon all of us to insist that nations like Iran and North Korea do not game the system. Those who claim to respect international law cannot avert their eyes when those laws are flouted. Those who care for their own security cannot ignore the danger of an arms race in the Middle East or East Asia. Those who seek peace cannot stand idly by as nations arm themselves for nuclear war.</p>

			<p>The same principle applies to those who violate international laws by brutalizing their own people. When there is genocide in Darfur, systematic rape in Congo, repression in Burma &mdash; there must be consequences. Yes, there will be engagement; yes, there will be diplomacy &mdash; but there must be consequences when those things fail. And the closer we stand together, the less likely we will be faced with the choice between armed intervention and complicity in oppression.</p>
