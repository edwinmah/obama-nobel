			<p class="intro">This brings me to a second point &mdash; the nature of the peace that we seek. For peace is not merely the absence of visible conflict. Only a just peace based on the inherent rights and dignity of every individual can truly be lasting.</p>

			<p>It was this insight that drove drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights after the Second World War. In the wake of devastation, they recognized that if human rights are not protected, peace is a hollow promise.</p>

			<p>And yet too often, these words are ignored. For some countries, the failure to uphold human rights is excused by the false suggestion that these are somehow Western principles, foreign to local cultures or stages of a nation&rsquo;s development. And within America, there has long been a tension between those who describe themselves as realists or idealists &mdash; a tension that suggests a stark choice between the narrow pursuit of interests or an endless campaign to impose our values around the world.</p>

			<p>I reject these choices. I believe that peace is unstable where citizens are denied the right to speak freely or worship as they please; choose their own leaders or assemble without fear. Pent-up grievances fester, and the suppression of tribal and religious identity can lead to violence. We also know that the opposite is true. Only when Europe became free did it finally find peace. America has never fought a war against a democracy, and our closest friends are governments that protect the rights of their citizens. No matter how callously defined, neither America&rsquo;s interests &mdash; nor the world&rsquo;s &mdash; are served by the denial of human aspirations.</p>


			<p class="pullquote" aria-hidden="true">&hellip; a just peace includes not only civil and political rights &mdash; it must encompass economic security and opportunity. For true peace is not just freedom from fear, but freedom from want.</p>


			<p>So even as we respect the unique culture and traditions of different countries, America will always be a voice for those aspirations that are universal. We will bear witness to the quiet dignity of reformers like Aung Sang Suu Kyi; to the bravery of Zimbabweans who cast their ballots in the face of beatings; to the hundreds of thousands who have marched silently through the streets of Iran. It is telling that the leaders of these governments fear the aspirations of their own people more than the power of any other nation. And it is the responsibility of all free people and free nations to make clear that these movements &mdash; these movements of hope and history &mdash; they have us on their side.</p>

			<p>Let me also say this: The promotion of human rights cannot be about exhortation alone. At times, it must be coupled with painstaking diplomacy. I know that engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation. But I also know that sanctions without outreach &mdash; condemnation without discussion &mdash; can carry forward only a crippling status quo. No repressive regime can move down a new path unless it has the choice of an open door.</p>

			<p>In light of the Cultural Revolution&rsquo;s horrors, Nixon&rsquo;s meeting with Mao appeared inexcusable &mdash; and yet it surely helped set China on a path where millions of its citizens have been lifted from poverty and connected to open societies. Pope John Paul&rsquo;s engagement with Poland created space not just for the Catholic Church, but for labor leaders like Lech Walesa. Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s efforts on arms control and embrace of perestroika not only improved relations with the Soviet Union, but empowered dissidents throughout Eastern Europe. There&rsquo;s no simple formula here. But we must try as best we can to balance isolation and engagement, pressure and incentives, so that human rights and dignity are advanced over time.</p>

			<p>Third, a just peace includes not only civil and political rights &mdash; it must encompass economic security and opportunity. For true peace is not just freedom from fear, but freedom from want.</p>

			<p>It is undoubtedly true that development rarely takes root without security; it is also true that security does not exist where human beings do not have access to enough food, or clean water, or the medicine and shelter they need to survive. It does not exist where children can&rsquo;t aspire to a decent education or a job that supports a family. The absence of hope can rot a society from within.</p>

			<p>And that&rsquo;s why helping farmers feed their own people &mdash; or nations educate their children and care for the sick &mdash; is not mere charity. It&rsquo;s also why the world must come together to confront climate change. There is little scientific dispute that if we do nothing, we will face more drought, more famine, more mass displacement &mdash; all of which will fuel more conflict for decades. For this reason, it is not merely scientists and environmental activists who call for swift and forceful action &mdash; it&rsquo;s military leaders in my own country and others who understand our common security hangs in the balance.</p>

			<p>Agreements among nations. Strong institutions. Support for human rights. Investments in development. All these are vital ingredients in bringing about the evolution that President Kennedy spoke about. And yet, I do not believe that we will have the will, the determination, the staying power, to complete this work without something more &mdash; and that&rsquo;s the continued expansion of our moral imagination; an insistence that there&rsquo;s something irreducible that we all share.</p>

			<p>As the world grows smaller, you might think it would be easier for human beings to recognize how similar we are; to understand that we&rsquo;re all basically seeking the same things; that we all hope for the chance to live out our lives with some measure of happiness and fulfillment for ourselves and our families.</p>

			<p>And yet somehow, given the dizzying pace of globalization, the cultural leveling of modernity, it perhaps comes as no surprise that people fear the loss of what they cherish in their particular identities &mdash; their race, their tribe, and perhaps most powerfully their religion. In some places, this fear has led to conflict. At times, it even feels like we&rsquo;re moving backwards. We see it in the Middle East, as the conflict between Arabs and Jews seems to harden. We see it in nations that are torn asunder by tribal lines.</p>

			<p class="pullquote" aria-hidden="true">Let us reach for the world that ought to be &mdash; that spark of the divine that still stirs within each of our souls.</p>

			<p>And most dangerously, we see it in the way that religion is used to justify the murder of innocents by those who have distorted and defiled the great religion of Islam, and who attacked my country from Afghanistan. These extremists are not the first to kill in the name of God; the cruelties of the Crusades are amply recorded. But they remind us that no Holy War can ever be a just war. For if you truly believe that you are carrying out divine will, then there is no need for restraint &mdash; no need to spare the pregnant mother, or the medic, or the Red Cross worker, or even a person of one&rsquo;s own faith. Such a warped view of religion is not just incompatible with the concept of peace, but I believe it&rsquo;s incompatible with the very purpose of faith &mdash; for the one rule that lies at the heart of every major religion is that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us.</p>

			<p>Adhering to this law of love has always been the core struggle of human nature. For we are fallible. We make mistakes, and fall victim to the temptations of pride, and power, and sometimes evil. Even those of us with the best of intentions will at times fail to right the wrongs before us.</p>

			<p>But we do not have to think that human nature is perfect for us to still believe that the human condition can be perfected. We do not have to live in an idealized world to still reach for those ideals that will make it a better place. The non-violence practiced by men like Gandhi and King may not have been practical or possible in every circumstance, but the love that they preached &mdash; their fundamental faith in human progress &mdash; that must always be the North Star that guides us on our journey.</p>

			<p>For if we lose that faith &mdash; if we dismiss it as silly or naïve; if we divorce it from the decisions that we make on issues of war and peace &mdash; then we lose what&rsquo;s best about humanity. We lose our sense of possibility. We lose our moral compass.</p>

			<p>Like generations have before us, we must reject that future. As Dr. King said at this occasion so many years ago, &ldquo;I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history. I refuse to accept the idea that the &rsquo;isness&rsquo; of man&rsquo;s present condition makes him morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal &rsquo;oughtness&rsquo; that forever confronts him.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Let us reach for the world that ought to be &mdash; that spark of the divine that still stirs within each of our souls. (Applause.)</p>

			<p>Somewhere today, in the here and now, in the world as it is, a soldier sees he&rsquo;s outgunned, but stands firm to keep the peace. Somewhere today, in this world, a young protestor awaits the brutality of her government, but has the courage to march on. Somewhere today, a mother facing punishing poverty still takes the time to teach her child, scrapes together what few coins she has to send that child to school &mdash; because she believes that a cruel world still has a place for that child&rsquo;s dreams.</p>

			<p>Let us live by their example. We can acknowledge that oppression will always be with us, and still strive for justice. We can admit the intractability of depravation, and still strive for dignity. Clear-eyed, we can understand that there will be war, and still strive for peace. We can do that &mdash; for that is the story of human progress; that&rsquo;s the hope of all the world; and at this moment of challenge, that must be our work here on Earth.</p>

			<p>Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p>
